# PONG
This folder contains three files:

1. my_first_game.py<br>
This is the script containing the Python code for running the game Pong. The script requires the Pygame framework to be installed. I wrote the script using Python 3.9. 

2. ball_hit.wav<br>
This is a sound effect used for the bat hitting the ball.

3. The_Matrix.wav<br>
This is a soundtrack used for the background music when the game is running.
