## Fleet management tool

The fleet management tool is a program that allows the user to add, remove and modify cars in a fleet. The fleet can be saved into and loaded from a file. 

This project was initially created to practice using objects (classes) in Python environment and using functions to allow the user to choose from different options presented in the main menu.

The program involved learning about global and local variables, dictionaries, and data serialisation/deserialisation into a JSON format.

The project consists of three files: 
- car.py<br>Provides the declaration and the implementation of the Car class.
- flota.py<br>The actual implementation of the program with the main menu and the supporting functions.
- haversine.py<br>Adds the functionality of calculating the distance covered by a Car based on two geographical points.
