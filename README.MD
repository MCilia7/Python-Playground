# Python playground

This repository contains a set of scripts that I have created while learning to program in Python. 

Each script has a slightly different difficulty level, all of which contributed to my ongoing Python journey.

I will continue to build my portfolio of Python projects, and I would appreciate any feedback for improvements.
