# PONG v2
This folder contains three files:

1. my_second_game.py<br>
This is the script containing the Python code for running the game Pong. It differs from v1 as it uses objects to manipulate the elements of the game. 
The script requires the Pygame framework to be installed. I wrote the script using Python 3.9. 

2. ball_hit.wav<br>
This is a sound effect used for the bat hitting the ball.

3. ace_ventura.wav<br>
This is a soundtrack used for the background music when the game is running.
